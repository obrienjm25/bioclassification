#Biological Classification


***
Ecological representativity and connectivity are cornerstones of effective MPA network design.  The National Framework for Canada's Network of MPAs outlines these design objectives as “facilitating the protection of ecological processes essential for ecosystem functioning”. Ecological processes in this sense reflect the summation and interconnectivity of species and their function within the ecosystem. An ecological classification system that partitions the seascape into homogenous spatial units, based on environmental and biological variables, can be used as a basis to evaluate representativity targets and select model species. 

MPA network design is challenged by the very species diversity it aims to protect. Indeed, the magnitude of biological complexity characterizing marine systems renders incorporating biological attributes of all species intractable. By categorizing this biological diversity hierarchically, and delineating it spatially, we will provide a novel, ecosystem-based tool to achieve representativity targets when designing MPAs. Moreover, we will provide pragmatic approach to identify key species on which to base design and monitoring (i.e., connectivity, size and spacing).

This project will develop a biophysical database, which integrates species-specific observational information, functional traits, and environmental correlates of species presence (_Panels A-C_). From this database we will delineate taxonomic and functional assemblages and use environmental assignment models (random forest) to project groupings spatially as contiguous ecological classifications (_Panels D-E_). Using climatological forecasts, we will compare current and future spatial classifications to characterize the risk of climate associated change (_Panel F_). From these classifications, we will identify emblematic species for more detailed connectivity analyses and future monitoring (_Panel G_)
